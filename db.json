      "about": "The concept of this title, the latest in the series to depict a new \"Atelier\" world, is \"True-to-life youths that develop together, even if just a little bit\". It is the story of a girl and her friends who are about to become adults, discovering what is most important to them. To depict the story of the main characters discovering things they've never seen before, we've created fields with natural shadows that allow you to feel the breath of the world. Graphics have been further enhanced, allowing for a world of daily-life and adventure to be depicted in a new way.  Advanced \"Synthesis\" system & \"Location Points\" The \"Synthesis\" system in which players combine materials to create items has been revamped. Now, in addition to being able to understand the effects of synthesis visually, the system allows you to enjoy the experience of developing recipes more than ever before. Also, we've included \"Location Points\" that players can create through synthesis!  Use different items to gather new materials! When \"Gathering\" the necessary materials for synthesis, the items you receive change depending on the tools you use to gather them, so it will be easier to obtain the items you want.  intense Battles With a combination of turn-based command battle and real time elements, enjoy intense battles where the choices you make determine the outcome!
